# Project_Virtual_Keyboard_C64
Controlling a C64 via virtual keyboard 

## For now this is just a brief overview of the things we will include in this project. Expect changes to come.

## Things to include:
- [x] Programming of a virtual keyboard on the Raspberry PI (preferably with Python)

- [x] Building the adapter for the C64 (connecting Raspberry PI 0 and MT8808 via Bluetooth and preparing connectors for the Ultimate II and the joystick switcher)

- [x] Programming the Raspberry software (receiving the signals and controlling the MT8808)

- [x] Construction of a Y-keyboard connector which allows the connection of the MT8808 and the original keyboard.
